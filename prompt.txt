create a website named कला.
it is a website where unrecognized art tallents get a platform to express themselves
various types of sketches, arts and designs are kept for sale for a very very cheap price
the students who are at school level but have extraordinary art skills will get a platform to show their tallents
people can buy those arts and support the students.
the arts will be very cheap. as cheap as NPR 200, NPR 300, NPR 500 or maximum NPR 1500.
